# Introduction to BrowserAI

Welcome to BrowserAI, the cutting-edge framework that empowers developers to integrate and run Large Language Models (LLMs) directly in the browser. With BrowserAI, harnessing the power of advanced AI becomes seamless, efficient, and incredibly accessible.

## Overview: Core Platform Features

### Develop

- **Intelligent Hardware Probing:** Automatically detect and utilize the best available hardware to optimize performance. Learn more in our [Local Hardware Guide](/concepts/local-hardware).
- **Declarative AI Integration:** Simple APIs to integrate LLMs into your web apps without worrying about underlying complexities. Check out our [Getting Started](/getting-started).
- **Multi-Model Support:** Compatibility with various LLM architectures and versions. Explore more in our [Models](/concepts/models) section.
- **Optimized Performance:** Efficient use of WebAssembly (WASM) for high-speed processing.

### Monitor

- **Real-Time Progress Tracking:** Provide feedback to users on model loading times and progress. Implement this using our [Model Loading Guide](/concepts/model-loading).
- **Advanced Analytics:** Track and analyze model performance to ensure optimal user experience.

### Test

- **Flexible Integration:** Supports popular frontend libraries like React, Vue, and Svelte.
- **Live-Reload and Debugging:** Ensure a smooth development workflow with built-in live-reload and debugging tools.

## The Need for BrowserAI

As the demand for intelligent web applications grows, so does the need for on-device AI processing. Running LLMs directly in the browser offers numerous benefits:

1. **Privacy:** Data never leaves the user's device, ensuring maximum privacy and security.
2. **Performance:** Real-time processing without the latency of server round-trips.
3. **Accessibility:** AI capabilities accessible even without a stable internet connection.
4. **Cost-Efficiency:** Reduce server costs and dependency on cloud-based AI services.

## The Evolution of Large Language Models

Over the past few years, the size and complexity of Large Language Models have increased dramatically. Models like GPT-3, with 175 billion parameters, were once unimaginable to run on local devices due to their immense computational demands. These cutting-edge models required powerful cloud-based servers and specialized hardware to operate effectively.

However, with the continuous advancement in computer technology, particularly following Moore's Law, which predicts the doubling of transistors in integrated circuits approximately every two years, we are now witnessing a significant shift. Modern GPUs have become increasingly powerful, enabling even relatively modern personal computers to handle sophisticated AI models.

### Moore's Law and GPU Advancements

The acceleration of modern computing capabilities, particularly in GPU technology, has paved the way for running advanced AI models directly on devices. This progress means that models, which previously could only run on high-end servers, can now be comfortably executed on consumer-grade hardware. This democratization of AI technology opens up new possibilities for developers and users alike.
