# Managing Context in BrowserAI

In complex AI applications, especially in conversational AI and assistant workflows, maintaining context across interactions is crucial. BrowserAI provides powerful tools to keep track of context and return an ID that can be used in subsequent interactions. This guide explains how to leverage these features to build robust and coherent AI-driven applications.

## What is Context?

Context refers to the information that is preserved across multiple interactions in an AI system. This information helps the AI understand the current state of the conversation, user preferences, and other relevant details, allowing for more meaningful and coherent interactions.

### Example: Context in a Conversational Assistant

In a back-and-forth conversation with a virtual assistant, context allows the assistant to remember previous questions and answers, making the conversation flow naturally. For instance, if a user asks about the weather and then follows up with a question about what to wear, the assistant can use the context to provide a relevant answer based on the earlier query.

## Keeping Track of Context

BrowserAI enables you to maintain and manage context effectively. You can create a context, update it with new information, and retrieve it later using a unique context ID.

### Creating and Updating Context

When initializing a conversation or interaction, you can create a new context and update it as needed:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { createContext, updateContext } from 'browserai';

function ChatBot() {
  const [contextId, setContextId] = useState(null);
  const [response, setResponse] = useState('');

  const startConversation = async () => {
    const newContextId = await createContext();
    setContextId(newContextId);
  };

  const handleUserInput = async (input) => {
    const updatedResponse = await updateContext(contextId, { input });
    setResponse(updatedResponse);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>ChatBot with Context</h1>
      {!contextId ? (
        <button onClick={startConversation}>Start Conversation</button>
      ) : (
        <div>
          <input type="text" onBlur={(e) => handleUserInput(e.target.value)} />
          <p>Response: {response}</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default ChatBot;
```

### Using Context ID

The context ID returned when you create a context can be used in future interactions to retrieve and update the context. This ensures that all relevant information is maintained throughout the session.

### Example: Continuing a Conversation

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { getContext, updateContext } from 'browserai';

function ContinueConversation() {
  const [contextId, setContextId] = useState('existing-context-id');
  const [response, setResponse] = useState('');

  const continueConversation = async (input) => {
    const currentContext = await getContext(contextId);
    const updatedResponse = await updateContext(contextId, { ...currentContext, input });
    setResponse(updatedResponse);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Continue Conversation</h1>
      <input type="text" onBlur={(e) => continueConversation(e.target.value)} />
      <p>Response: {response}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ContinueConversation;
```

## Benefits of Using Context

1. **Coherence**: Maintaining context helps ensure that interactions are coherent and relevant, improving the user experience.
2. **Personalization**: Context allows the system to remember user preferences and past interactions, enabling personalized responses.
3. **Efficiency**: With context, the AI can process subsequent interactions more efficiently by leveraging previously gathered information.

## Conclusion

Effective context management is essential for building sophisticated and user-friendly AI applications. BrowserAI's context management features provide the tools you need to create, update, and utilize context across interactions, enhancing the capabilities and responsiveness of your AI systems.
