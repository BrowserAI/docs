# Model Loading

Efficiently loading models is crucial for ensuring that your AI-powered application remains responsive and provides a seamless user experience. This guide covers how to load models in BrowserAI, monitor their loading status, and provide feedback to the user.

## Key Concepts

When using a model, it is essential to know whether the model is loaded or not. Additionally, providing users with feedback on the loading progress can enhance the user experience. BrowserAI offers tools to help you manage and monitor the loading process effectively.

## Loading Models

To load a model in BrowserAI, you can use the `loadModel` function. This function loads the model asynchronously and allows you to track its loading status.

### Example: Loading a Model

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { loadModel } from 'browserai';

function App() {
  const [model, setModel] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [loadingProgress, setLoadingProgress] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchModel() {
      const loadedModel = await loadModel('Mistral 7B', (progress) => {
        setLoadingProgress(progress);
      });
      setModel(loadedModel);
      setLoading(false);
    }
    fetchModel();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>AI-Powered Application</h1>
      {loading ? (
        <p>Loading model... {loadingProgress}%</p>
      ) : (
        <p>Model loaded successfully!</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the `loadModel` function takes a callback to update the loading progress. This allows you to provide real-time feedback to the user about the loading status.

## Monitoring Loading Status

BrowserAI provides a constant interface to let users know how long it has taken so far to load the model and how much time is left approximately.

### Example: Monitoring Loading Status

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { loadModel, getModelLoadingStatus } from 'browserai';

function App() {
  const [model, setModel] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [loadingProgress, setLoadingProgress] = useState(0);
  const [timeElapsed, setTimeElapsed] = useState(0);
  const [timeRemaining, setTimeRemaining] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    let startTime = Date.now();

    async function fetchModel() {
      const loadedModel = await loadModel('Mistral 7B', (progress) => {
        setLoadingProgress(progress);
        let currentTime = Date.now();
        let elapsed = (currentTime - startTime) / 1000; // time in seconds
        setTimeElapsed(elapsed);
        setTimeRemaining((elapsed / progress) * (100 - progress));
      });
      setModel(loadedModel);
      setLoading(false);
    }

    fetchModel();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>AI-Powered Application</h1>
      {loading ? (
        <div>
          <p>Loading model... {loadingProgress}%</p>
          <p>Time elapsed: {timeElapsed.toFixed(2)} seconds</p>
          {timeRemaining && <p>Estimated time remaining: {timeRemaining.toFixed(2)} seconds</p>}
        </div>
      ) : (
        <p>Model loaded successfully!</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, we use the `loadModel` function with a callback to update both the loading progress and time estimates. The `getModelLoadingStatus` function can be used to fetch real-time updates about the loading status, which includes progress, elapsed time, and estimated time remaining.

## Providing User Feedback

Providing clear feedback to users about the loading status of the model can significantly enhance the user experience. Make sure to display the loading progress and estimated time remaining prominently in your application.

### Tips for Effective User Feedback

- **Loading Indicator**: Use a progress bar or spinner to indicate that the model is loading.
- **Progress Percentage**: Display the percentage of the model that has been loaded so far.
- **Time Estimates**: Show the time elapsed and the estimated time remaining to give users a sense of how long the loading will take.
- **Loading Completion**: Notify users when the model has been loaded successfully.

## Conclusion

Efficient model loading and clear user feedback are essential for creating a smooth and responsive AI-powered application. By leveraging BrowserAI's capabilities, you can ensure that your models are loaded efficiently and that users are kept informed throughout the process.
