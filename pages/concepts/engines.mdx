## Mobile Platforms

While Mysterian primarily targets desktop environments due to their higher computational resources, it can also function on mobile platforms with some considerations:

- **iOS/iPadOS:** Works through WebKit-based browsers (Safari, Chrome for iOS)
- **Android:** Supported on Chromium-based browsers and Firefox

**Note:** Performance on mobile devices may vary depending on the device's capabilities and the complexity of the LLM being used.

## Performance Considerations

The performance of Mysterian can vary across different engines and platforms. Factors that can affect performance include:

- JavaScript engine optimizations
- WebAssembly support and performance
- Available system resources (CPU, GPU, memory)
- Implementation of Web Workers and other multithreading capabilities

We recommend testing your Mysterian-based application across multiple engines and platforms to ensure optimal performance and compatibility.

## Future Support
